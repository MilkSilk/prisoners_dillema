# prisoners_dillema
Project based around the prisoners dillema, contains a basic simulator for user defined prisoners and a q-learning solution

# usage
To run the project simply go into /src/runner/main.py and define which function you'd like to use.
For user defined prisoners (the simulation part) edit the predefined_prisoners() function and call it under if __name__ == "__main__":
For q-learning just run q_learning_experiment()
